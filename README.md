# <i>iBPM - Characterization and improvement of new scheduling policies in hospitals</i>
### 1. Description
- The project's main objective is the study and characterization of new policies for scheduling
consultations in Family Health Units (USF), with a view to better quality of service
provided, particularly with regard to waiting times.
- To achieve the above mentioned objective, a discrete event simulator was developed that
allows you to compare the gains achieved with different scheduling policies, compared to the current model
that the simulator in a first phase emulates.
- This simulator has other advantages, in that it allows you to test and evaluate types of schedules
different for health professionals according to their impact on waiting times for
queries.
