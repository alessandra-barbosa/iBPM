# <i>iBPM - Characterization and improvement of new scheduling policies in hospitals</i>
### 1. Description
The project's main objective is the study and characterization of new policies for scheduling
consultations in Family Health Units (USF), with a view to better quality of service
provided, particularly with regard to waiting times.
To achieve the above mentioned objective, a discrete event simulator was developed that
allows you to compare the gains achieved with different scheduling policies, compared to the current model
that the simulator in a first phase emulates.
This simulator has other advantages, in that it allows you to test and evaluate types of schedules
different for health professionals according to their impact on waiting times for
queries.
